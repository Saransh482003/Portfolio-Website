        "description":"I'm currently engaged in a project to develop a Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) library entirely from scratch. This ambitious endeavor involves hand-coding a wide range of DSA algorithms, including search algorithms, sorting techniques, graph algorithms, and more. The objective is to create a comprehensive resource that offers in-depth insight into the inner workings of these fundamental algorithms. \nThis project serves as an educational and practical tool for the DSA community, providing hands-on experience in implementing and understanding core DSA concepts. The library is a work in progress, continually expanding to cover various aspects of DSA to benefit learners and practitioners alike."   ,
