        "description":"I worked on a Machine Learning project, which I like to call 'The Fitting of 6 Models', (a bit poetic). The project deals with the classification of mobile phones in 4 price ranges based on their hardware features. The 6 Models used are: 1) Logistic Regression 2) KNN Classifier 3) KNN Regressor 4) Support Vector Machines (SVM) 5) Decision Trees 6) Random Forest. The best accuracy of 96% was achieved by SVM model, followed by 95% of Logistic Regression. Also, hyperparameter tuning was done using Cross Validation technique to achieve the best possible accuracy in every case."   ,
