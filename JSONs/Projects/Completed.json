        "description":"Introducing 'The Fitting of 6 Models,' a compelling venture encapsulating my journey in the domain of machine learning. In this project, I undertook the classification of mobile phones into four distinct price ranges, harnessing the capabilities of six diverse models: Logistic Regression, KNN Classifier, KNN Regressor, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Trees, and Random Forest. \nNotably, the SVM model emerged as the standout performer, boasting an impressive 96% accuracy, closely followed by Logistic Regression at 95%. This project, backed by rigorous hyperparameter tuning using the Cross Validation technique, exemplifies my commitment to data-driven precision. It underscores the potential of data science in solving real-world challenges with finesse and analytical prowess."   ,
